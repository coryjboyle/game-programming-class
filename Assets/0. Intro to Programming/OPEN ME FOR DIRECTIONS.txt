Hello game developers! To get started, double click the scene file called "Programming 101".

Once that is opened, double click on ExampleScript which will walk you through an example script file.
The IntroToVariables script has a brief overview of what variables are and how to use them.

Don't forget: you can click the Play button (looks like a triangle) at the top center of the Unity window to start the game.
Note that in Unity, any changes you make while the game is playing will be reset when you stop the game.
